# NikeEventRegistration

**Simple Python script that uses Selenium to register to an Nike Instore Event.**

I might update it with requests module when I have time to waste

*Made within hours so I'm sorry for the shitty coding...*

-Tested on OFF WHITE (main.py) event release, worked like a charm

**-Now support Travis Scott AF1 release (check travis.py)**

PS: Do not forget to change links to your location and add accounts proxies etc...
